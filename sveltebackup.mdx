# Use TakeShape with Svelte

If you love Svelte's simplicity, you'll love how easy and fast it is to integrate a TakeShape project into your Svelte projects.

Let's take a look at the process now!


# Starting up a Svelte project

If you're interested in jumping straight in, [Svelte has documentation on the easiest way to start a Svelte app](https://svelte.dev/blog/the-easiest-way-to-get-started).

For simplicity's sake, we'll be using [Svelte's Hello World example project](https://svelte.dev/repl/hello-world?version=3.42.1). Download it and open up your terminal inside the project directory to begin. You'll need to install all the project's dependencies. Simply run:

`npm install`

And you're ready to go!


# Getting your TakeShape project information

To connect your TakeShape Project, you'll need its API Endpoint, and a valid API Key.

To find the endpoint, navigate to your project's Home tab in the TakeShape web client. On the bottom right, you'll see a section called Useful Snippets. You can copy your API Key from there. Refer to the image below:

<Image img={require('./images/general/useful-snippets.png')} alt="TakeShape Useful Snippets Web Interface"/>

For information on generating an API Key, [check out our docs on the subject](/api/api-keys).

:::info INFO
Environment variables have no officially-supported implementation in Svelte yet, so be sure to set give your API Key read-only permissions when you create it.

# Connecting TakeShape to your Svelte Project


## Creating an Apollo client

Apollo is the simplest way to add GraphQL queries to your Svelte components. In order to get an Apollo client running, let's first install all the necessary dependencies:

`npm i @apollo/client svelte-apollo apollo-cache-inmemory apollo-link-http graphql-tag`

With that done, open up the `App.svelte` file in the `src` folder of your project. It's time to configure our Apollo client.

In the `<script>` tags of your component, import all the necessary dependencies as shown below:

```html title="App.svelte"
<script>
	import { ApolloClient } from "@apollo/client";
	import { setClient } from "svelte-apollo";
	import { query } from "svelte-apollo";
	import { InMemoryCache } from "apollo-cache-inmemory";
	import { HttpLink } from "apollo-link-http";
	import gql from 'graphql-tag'
</script>
```

Now we're ready for our Apollo client configuration code. Start with creating an `HttpLink` object, which will take our Endpoint and API Key, so we can connect to our TakeShape project.

```javascript title="App.svelte"	
	const link = new HttpLink({
		uri: 'https://api.takeshape.io/project/6cdbcc52-5697-475b-872e-fcb6fd0e00d0/v3/graphql',
		fetch,
		headers: {
			Authorization : `Bearer 7b9171f34e104aeba972941bcfb7767d`
		}
	});
```

Almost done. Now we'll create an ApolloClient object, which will manage our connection to our TakeShape endpoint. All that's necessary after that is setting the client with the `setClient` method we imported.

```javascript title="App.svelte"
	const client = new ApolloClient({
  		link: link,
		cache: new InMemoryCache({
			addTypename: true
		})
	});
	setClient(client);
```

We're all set! Now to make a query, we just define it using the `gql` tag we've imported. For this example, we'll be pulling data about product collections from an Ecommerce backend. Here's an example query:

```javascript title="App.svelte"
	const collectionList = query(gql`
		query  {
			getCollectionList{
				items{
					_id
					title
					products{
						name
						price
					}
				}
			}
		}
	`)
```

Your entire `<script>` should look like this:

```javascript title="App.svelte"
<script>
	import { ApolloClient } from "@apollo/client";
	import { setClient } from "svelte-apollo";
	import { query } from "svelte-apollo";
	import { InMemoryCache } from "apollo-cache-inmemory";
	import { HttpLink } from "apollo-link-http";
	import gql from 'graphql-tag'
	
	const link = new HttpLink({
		uri: 'https://api.takeshape.io/project/6cdbcc52-5697-475b-872e-fcb6fd0e00d0/v3/graphql',
		fetch,
		headers: {
			Authorization : `Bearer 7b9171f34e104aeba972941bcfb7767d`
		}
	});

	const client = new ApolloClient({
  		link: link,
		cache: new InMemoryCache({
			addTypename: true
		})
	});
	setClient(client);

	const collectionList = query(gql`
		query  {
			getCollectionList{
				items{
					_id
					title
					products{
						name
						price
					}
				}
			}
		}
	`)
</script>
```


## Adding data to your Svelte template

Here's the part that makes Svelte so beautiful! Adding data to your template is super easy. You'll use an `#if` block to conditionally render content based on whether or not the data has been loaded.

Within the `#if` block, we'll simply use `#each` blocks to render out HTML based on each piece of data we receive in the response from TakeShape's API Mesh. Check the code below:

```javascript title="App.svelte"
{#if $collectionList.loading}
  Loading...
{:else if $collectionList.error}
  Error: {$collectionList.error.message}
{:else}
  {#each $collectionList.data.getCollectionList.items as collection}
	<h2>{collection.title}</h2>
	<ul>
		{#each collection.products as product}
			<li>{product.name} : {product.price}</li>
		{/each}
	</ul>
  {/each}
{/if}
```

In the above code, we're waiting for our query to resolve and return data to our `collectionList` variable. Once that's done, we're cycling through its `items` array and rendering an `<h2>` and `<ul>` for each item. In this case, `items` represents our product collections. The list will be every product in the collection we're iterating over, alongside its price.

The final page should look like this:

<Image img={require('./images/svelte/final_page.png')} alt="TakeShape Svelte Example"/>

And the full `App.svelte` component should look like this:

```html title="App.svelte"
<script>
	import { ApolloClient } from "@apollo/client";
	import { setClient } from "svelte-apollo";
	import { query } from "svelte-apollo";
	import { InMemoryCache } from "apollo-cache-inmemory";
	import { HttpLink } from "apollo-link-http";
	import gql from 'graphql-tag'
	
	const link = new HttpLink({
		uri: 'https://api.takeshape.io/project/6cdbcc52-5697-475b-872e-fcb6fd0e00d0/v3/graphql',
		fetch,
		headers: {
			Authorization : `Bearer 7b9171f34e104aeba972941bcfb7767d`
		}
	});

	const client = new ApolloClient({
  		link: link,
		cache: new InMemoryCache({
			addTypename: true
		})
	});
	setClient(client);

	const collectionList = query(gql`
		query  {
			getCollectionList{
				items{
					_id
					title
					products{
						name
						price
					}
				}
			}
		}
	`)
</script>

{#if $collectionList.loading}
  Loading...
{:else if $collectionList.error}
  Error: {$collectionList.error.message}
{:else}
  {#each $collectionList.data.getCollectionList.items as collection}
	<h2>{collection.title}</h2>
	<ul>
		{#each collection.products as product}
			<li>{product.name} : {product.price}</li>
		{/each}
	</ul>
  {/each}
{/if}
```
